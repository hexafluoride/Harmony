# Harmony
Distributed storage system based on Chordette, an implementation of the Chord DHT

## What Harmony strives to be

* Efficient distributed storage designed to scale up and down to extreme network configurations
* An [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)-like layer
* A building block for distributed storage networks with high reliability, throughput, and capacity, and low latency
* A gateway to the P2P layer for clients that don't wish to run a full node

## Current state of Harmony

Harmony is not ready to be tested or used in production yet.

## License

Harmony is licensed under MIT.
